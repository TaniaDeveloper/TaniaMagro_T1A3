## Project Plan

I utilised Trello and created a kanban board, and listed all the items that I needed to complete.

**Working on tasks**

I had deadlines for action items, and created a checklist for grouped tasks. I also included brainstorm ideas or links to videos that I watched for reasrech purposes.

**Testing the terminal for each menu selection**

I also had progressed with completing some of the tasks, that were on my action board. I had utilised placing dates for when certain items were due to be completed, however not all tasks were completed within the alloted time frame.

**All tasks completed**

All tasks have now been completed for the terminal application.

I enjoyed using Trello, within the environment I have created. Have previously used Jira within my organisation however now utilise Microsoft Project (Web), which is moving into Planner. Each of the systems have their strengths and weakneses, and it has been great to be able to use different sytems for different context.
